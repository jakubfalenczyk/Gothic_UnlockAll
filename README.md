# Description

After a few playthroughs, I got tired of the lockpicking mini-game since I always saved and loaded before opening a chest to avoid losing a lockpick.

This mod was created as a solution to that.

With this mod, if you have the lockpicking skill learned, you can unlock chests instantly with a single key!

The default hotkey is KEY_V (Gothic 1) and MOUSE_BUTTONRIGHT (Gothic 2), but you can customize it in Gothic.ini. After launching the mod for the first time, a new section will be created where you can edit the settings.

# Settings

[UNLOCKALL]

UnlockHotkey=KEY_V

// Hotkey for quickly unlocking chests/doors

SkipDoors=0

// Set this to 1 if you donâ€™t want the mod to work on doors. By default, the same button unlocks both chests and doors.
